# Project1
This project will simulate the stock market. This &quot;sim&quot; will include a trading account that tracks balance and stock
holdings, and it will include a stock market engine that will mimic the up and down movement of stocks. It will
also mimic the queue of requested trades that then get periodically resolved in bulk batches in order of trade
placement.
